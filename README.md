## Using Golang to create a microservice ecosystem

I hope to achieve the following from this:
1. Get better with Go (it's awesome!)
2. Improve my architecture skills
3. Learn and imrpove upon tools for microservices
4. More exposure to docker and makefiles

## Commands
To all the services: `make up_build`
The frontend service lives on port 80

Be sure to have docker installed
